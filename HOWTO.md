## **How to Write a Winning Resume**

### **TL;DR**: _Craft your narrative, then make every word count._

#### Rules

1. Your resume must have narrative.
    * Narrative must be obvious and consistent.
    * Don't make them guess - micro test each line.
2. Every word must earn it's place.
    * Without narrative, it's just words.
    * Take each line and ask "Why is this here?"
    * What message are you trying to convey?
    * Is it there "just because" or "couldn't hurt"? Don't.
